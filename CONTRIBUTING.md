### Workflow

Fork this repo on GitHub and use a pull request to propose a change.

When working on this (or any) Sublime Text package, you can symlink the repo
directory into your local "Packages" directory (Preferences → Browse Packages).
Files here will override the corresponding files in the published package from
Package Control, so you don't have to remove it. Sublime will also auto-reload
these files when they change.

See also the Sublime Text [Package Development][stdocs] documentation.
