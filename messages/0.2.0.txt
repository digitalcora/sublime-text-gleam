Since the original Gleam package was no longer maintained, this version is
actually a new package with a new maintainer. It no longer provides formatting;
to replicate the format-on-save behavior of the old package, you can use the
`Fmt` package (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Fmt). See here for details:
